What is Logging?
++++++++++++++++

Logging is the process of writting log messages during the execution of a program to a central place.

This Logging allows you to report and persist error and warning messages as well as info messages(e.g.,runtime statistics)so that the messages can later be retrieved and analyzed.

This is very helpful to understand exceptions in the applications which are deployed in higher environments like SIT,UAT,PILOT and PROD etc.

Drawbacks of System.out.println :
---------------------------------
if we use SOP(System.out.println())statements to print log messages,then we can run into some disadvantages 

	->we can print log on the console only.so,when the console is closed,we will lose 	  all of those logs.
	->we can't store log messages in any permanent place.These messages will print 	  one by one on the console because it is a single-threaded environment.

To Overcome these problems,the Log4j framework came into the picture.Log4j is an open source framework provided by Apache  for Java Projects.
